Hello, I'm Okeke Promise and this is my attempt at the assignment given

I've used extra dependencies which I felt added more usability to the project,
=> react-router-dom: This isn't an optional dependency but just wanted to include it
=> TailwindCss: It's utility classes helped me styled faster
=> react-hot-toast: I used this to show little bit of info

I also used gemini as well deepseek to get an accurate color pallete of the project

To run this project, you'd have to use first clone it using git clone
=> then when on your system, install all dependencies using npm install
=> then use 'npm run dev' to get a local development server

That's all.
Thank You
